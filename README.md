## Description:

- __Imperative Interpretor in Functional Language.scm__ defines an imperative interpretor that both validates and interprets a given program as input.
The program input is written and interpreted in a fabricated language known as ART-C. For the full syntax, semantics, and precedence of ART-C please
view the additional readme file. The additional readme file is the original assignment description. __This file is called _Imperative Language in a Functional Language.pdf_.__

## How to build the software

Scheme compiles at run time


## How to use the software

Run with Dr. Racket or any other scheme/common-lisp interpretor


## How the software was tested

Testing was completed by using a fully fabricated ART-C program as test input. The test input is defined in the scheme file.
